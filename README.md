# WEB222 Assignment3 Static Website
I created this website as a part of my assignment for WEB222. I have mainly used HTML for this website and have also used class-less CSS to style the website. You can access the website [here](https://aryank1511.github.io/WEB222-Assignment3-Static-Website/). 

# Disclaimer
Please don't just copy the code mindlessly without trying to solve the problems yourself, it's totally pointless if you actually wanna learn how to write software and a blatant violation of the [Academic Integrity](https://www.senecacollege.ca/about/policies/academic-integrity-policy.html) policy of the course.
